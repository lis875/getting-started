This is the lab project for the first week of class.   The main goal here is 
just to get the python program running on your own computer.

To run this program, at the command line, enter
```
    python eliza.py
```

It should look like this, though you will enter in your own responses:

```
Welcome to Eliza!
How are you feeling today?
> hello
Hello!  Glad you could be here today.
> Thank you.  I am feeling OK
How long have you been that way?
> I've been OK all day
How do you feel when you say that?
> I feel happy
Do you often feel that?
> Umm, most of the time?
I see
> Goodbye
Goodbye!
```
